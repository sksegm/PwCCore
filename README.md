# Core

Core creates workpapers based on Caseware and Customer data.

The data consists of financial entries and may span up to 6 financial periods, the year in question, next year and up to 4 years back.

When we use Core, we are guided through the process of validating, balancing and anotating the data. Here is a short description of how to create workpapers with Core:

1) First we open the Core workbook.
2) If the page "Start Core" is not shown, then we navigate back until we see the "Start Forfra" menu; then we click the menu.
3) We click the "Start Core" button, when the page "Start Core" is shown, 
4) We select the caseware and customer data to import.
5) We use the wizard until we  reach the page "Filer til Aura"
6) Finally we select the workpapers we want and click "Dan filer til Aura".
7) If we need more workpapers, we click the menu "Filer til Aura" and repeat step 6.
