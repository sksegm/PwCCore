# Core

Core creates workpapers based on Caseware data and Customer data.

The Customer data consists of financial entries and may span up to 6 financial periods, the year in question, next year and up to 4 years back.

Here is a short description of how to create workpapers with Core:

1) We open the Core workbook.
2) If the page "Start Core" is not shown, then we navigate back until we see the "Start Forfra" menu; then we click the menu.
3) When the page "Start Core" is shown, we click the "Start Core" button.
4) We select the caseware data and customer data to import.
5) We are guided through the process of validating, balancing and anotating the data.
6) We use the wizard until we  reach the page "Filer til Aura"
7) Finally we select the workpapers we want and click "Dan filer til Aura".
8) If we need more workpapers, we click the menu "Filer til Aura" and select them; then we click "Dan filer til Aura".
