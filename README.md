# PwCCore
We often write Core instead of PwCCore.

Core creates workpapers based on Caseware data and Customer data. The Customer data consists of financial entries and may span up to 6 financial periods, the year in question, next year and up to 4 years back.

Here is a very short desciption of how to create workpapers with Core.

1) Open the Core workbook.
2) If the page "Start Core" is not shown, then navigate back until you can see the "Start Forfra" menu (near the upper left corner) and click it.
3) When the page "Start Core" is shown click the "Start Core" button.
4) We select the caseware data and customer data to import.
5) We are guided through the process of validating, balancing and anotating the data.
5) We use the wizard until we  reach the page "Filer til Aura"
6) We select workpapers we want and click "Dan filer til Aura"
